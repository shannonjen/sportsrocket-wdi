- The calculator should be able to store two values, `value1` and `value2`.

- Create `add`, `subtract`, `multiply`, and `divide` methods that perform these operations on the two values and return the results


## Elevator

- Instances of elevator should be aware of what floor they're on, have a method to go up or down, and have a method to announce a cheery greeting along with the current floor if the instance is asked (`.greet`)

- **Extra credit** (1 point): a method to play elevator music.
