# Homework

## Database Theory
1. Spend at least 30 minutes poring over the class notes and database diagrams we created in class. Make sure you understand the concepts listed and note any questions. If you can't find the answers to those questions by the time you're done with your homework or on Google, e-mail your instructor with your questions.

2. Create another database diagram for a large web company like Amazon, Netflix, Facebook, Flickr, or a company of your choice. Be sure to note primary and foreign keys, column data types, and the relationships between tables.

### Grading Criteria
1. While the diagram doesn't need to be completely correct, it is important that each attribute on the separate tables are clearly defined.
