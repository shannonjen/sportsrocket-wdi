## Assignment

1. Create the following functions:
      - Create a function that takes a string and adds the phrase "Only in America!" to the end of it
      - Create a function to find the maximum value in an array of numbers. For instance:
      `[100,10,-1000]`

         should return 100. **Do not use Ruby's built-in `.max` function.**

     - Create a function that takes two arguments - both of them arrays. Inside of the function, combine the arrays using the items from the first array as keys and the second array as values. For example, when these two arrays are supplied as arguments:

        ```ruby
          [:toyota, :tesla]
          ["Prius", "Model S"]
        ```
        they should return a hash like so:

        ```ruby
          {toyota: "Prius", tesla: "Model S"}
        ```

2. Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100, except:

    - for multiples of three print "Fizz" instead of the number
    - for multiples of five print "Buzz"
    - Print "FizzBuzz" for numbers that are multiples of both 3 and 5.

### Grading Criteria

- Build Only in America function in Ruby, with no errors
__3 Points__

- Build FizzBuzz in Ruby, with no errors
__3 Points__

- Build Nested Arrays function in Ruby, with no errors
__3 Points__

- Code is well commented and contains a ReadMe
__1 Points__

__Total__: 10 Points

1. The syntax is correct and the code is indented properly.
2. All scripts should output the expected result.
3. Ruby's built-in `.max` function is _not_ used
